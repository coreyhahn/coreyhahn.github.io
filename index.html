<h1>Median Sorting Networks > 64 Items</h1>
<p>Inspired by <a href=https://bertdobbelaere.github.io/median_networks.html>Median Sorting Networks <= 64. </a></p>
<p>Occasionally in FPGA design fast parallel median calculations are desired.  Large modern FPGAs allow these algorithms to be implemented allowing for fast median calculations
Optimizing a large median filter to utilize as few comparisons as possible allows for smaller footprints and faster clocks.</p>

<p>One options is to split a median data set into 2 half size sorts and then use a final 40 pair comparison to calculate the median.</p>
<p>Below is my work inspired by bertdobbelaere.  I implemented a greedy network finder and the best results so far are listed below.</p>

<p>I will post the greedy algorithm when I generalize for 64 < m < 129</p>
